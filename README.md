# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Prompt

This week's edX bootcamp challenge required me to write an application from near scratch that enables people to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML (That I was provided) and CSS powered by JavaScript code (that I actually wrote). It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes (The CSS for which was provided with the challenge).

## Deployment

## Notable Features

1. User can generate a full randomized password using 8 to 128 alphabet, numeric, or special characters; Optionally synthesizing any concoction all three character types for their desired password with capitalization applied to all or some alphabet characters, as the user desires.
2. If the user inputs a completely invalid option at any step of the process, the app will reset itself successfully, allowing for more immediate future successful use.
3. If the user inputs invalid characters WITH valid characters during the Options Phase (LUNS Phase), the program will only read the valid characters inputed. This is to allow room for accidental user typos while still delivering the full promised password. This feature may also assist those with motor function limitations who may make these user errors completely on accident. The desire is develop a password based on the user's intent, not their specific input, which may carry accidental flaws according to the specificities of how computers read human input.
4. The app has a fully functioning ReadMe. Hello, it's me. The ReadMe.
